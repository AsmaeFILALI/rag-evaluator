"""Externalized prompt templates for LLM-as-a-judge evaluators.

Each prompt constant is a tuple of ``(system_prompt, user_template)`` where
the user template uses ``{placeholders}`` that :meth:`BaseLLMJudge.evaluate`
fills from the ``EvaluationRecord``.

Keeping prompts here rather than buried inside evaluator logic makes them
easy to review, version-control, and override via ``evaluator_options``.
